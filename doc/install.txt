== Building and installing Upplay

=== Prerequisites

You will need:
 
- The Qt libraries development packages, including QtWebkit and QtNetwork.
- qmake.
- The development packages for libupnp version 1.6 (beware that the package
  is named libupnp6 on Debian and Ubuntu 14.04, but it was libupnp3 on
  Ubuntu 12.04), libcurl, and libexpat.
- Only for building from github source: the autotools (autoconf, automake,
  libtool). 

You need to download the release tar files for
http://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/downloads.html[libupnpp] and
link:downloads.html[upplay], or clone the git repositories: 
https://github.com/medoc92/libupnpp[libupnpp],
https://github.com/medoc92/upplay[upplay].

=== Building

Extract the source for libupnpp and upplay, use the following procedures to
build the two packages:

Building libupnpp:

    cd libupnpp-x.y.z
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

Building upplay:

    cd upplay-x.y.z
    qmake
    sudo make install

And you should now be able to _upplay_ 

The above examples are for source extracted from tar release files. For
github source, you need to adjust the names of the top directories, and use
the following command before the libupnpp 'configure':
  
    sh autogen.sh
