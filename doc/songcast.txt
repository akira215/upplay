= The Upplay Songcast dialog

The Songcast dialog lets you establish and terminate connections between
the existing Songcast Senders or Receivers on your network.

Songcast Sender modules currently

X].

upmpdcli also has a Songcast Sender additional package. Unlike the Mac and
Windows tools, this does not capture arbitrary audio on the Linux host, but
it is useful for synchronized multiroom audio.

Songcast Receiver modules come with Linn hardware, or with software
Renderers like

As far as I can see (disclosure: I am the author of `upmpdcli`) the
Songcast Receiver in Upmpdcli works much better at the moment (12-2015).

You will see Senders listed in the top part of the dialog if there are any
currently active on the local network.

The bottom part of the dialog list the Receivers, with their connected
state.

If a Sender is selected in the top part, you can check the `Link to
selected Sender` boxes, and click `Apply` to establish the connection(s).

Checking `Unlink` and clicking `Apply` will disconnect the selected
Receivers.

You will need to close and re-open the dialog to update the lists when
Senders appear, or Receivers appear or disappear from the network,

The Senders are currently not too good at advertising their demise, so you
may be better off restarting upplay after one goes away, to avoid timeouts
when using the dialog.
