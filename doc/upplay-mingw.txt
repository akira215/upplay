= Building upplay with MinGW

First install http://www.mingw.org/[MinGW] and 
http://www.qt.io/download/[Qt 5.5].

Also install http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php[innosetup], this will be
used to create the installer.

Start a command window running the Bash shell,
using `C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat`

*Change the PATH* to use the tools wich come with Qt 5.5, not the ones from
the MinGW install (which is mostly there to provide bash and tar
actually...). 

    export PATH=c:/qt/tools/mingw492_32/bin:$PATH

== libupnp

Clone it from https://github.com/medoc92/pupnp16, use the default branch
pupnp16-fixes, and follow the instructions in README_MINGW.txt

== curl 7.43.0

Download http://curl.haxx.se/download/curl-7.45.0.tar.gz[curl]
Extract it:

    cd c:\temp
    tar xf curl-7.45.0.tar.gz

Have a look at curl-7.45.0/docs/INSTALL: MinGW32 section

- *Do not* run configure, just "make mingw32"

    cd curl-7.45.0
    make mingw32
    
== expat

Download
http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/files/latest/download?source=files[expat
2.1.0]

Extract 

    cd expat-2.1.0
    configure
    make

=== libupnpp

Copy windows/config_windows.h to libupnpp/config.h

Then use windows/qmk/libupnpp.pro, possibly adjusting paths 

=== upplay

Open upplay.pro with Qt Creator. Possibly adjust the paths to
libupnp/curl/expat and libupnpp, build.

Then use the windows/mkinstdir.sh to create an installation directory, and
use the innosetup file windows/innosetup/upplay-setup.iss to create the
installer.
