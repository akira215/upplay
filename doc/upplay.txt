= Upplay manual

image::legend-upplay-main.png[]

== Player section

Play, Pause, Stop, Next, Previous, Seek, and Adjust volume. I would guess that
these don't need explanations.

Most elements displaying information about the current track have tooltips
which can display a bigger and more readable version.

== Playlist section

Playlist entries:

- Double-click entry to play
- Click entry, then click the play button to play
- Select and drag-drop to reorder
- Right click and select 'Remove' to delete current selection
- Right click and select 'Sort by track number' to reorder tracks (useful
  when tracks from an album directory were sent in wrong order by the Media
  Server).

Playlist buttons:

- Playlist modes select how the tracks are sequenced: normal, repeat,
  shuffle.
- Playlist add modes determine how "Send to playlist" from the directory
  browser will affect the playlist. By default, this inserts after the
  current track. You can also choose to Append or Replace, and opt to
  immediately start play for the first of the new tracks.
- The sequential number toggle will show numbers in front of the
  entries. Not too sure what this is good for...

You can clear the current playlist by clicking the broom icon above it on
the right.

== Directory browser section

The list at the top is a hybrid path/search history section:

 - When you browse a directory tree by clicking on containers, it shows
   your location in the tree.
 - If you perform searches, your search history will be stacked at the end
   of the path. Searches are not nested, and always relative to the closest
   directory earlier in the path. If you click a directory inside the
   search results, it will get stacked, and any further searches will be
   relative to this directory, not the earlier one.

Left-Clicking a track title will send it to the playlist, according to the
current playlist add mode.

Left-Clicking a directory title will get you there.

Right-clicking a track title will propose the following actions:

 - `Back`
 - `Send to playlist`: same as left-clicking.
 - `Send all to playlist`: send all tracks from this directory.
 - `Send all from here to playlist`: this track and the following ones go to
   the playlist.
 
Right-clicking a directory (in the list or in the path) will propose the
following actions:

- `Back`
- `Send to playlist`: this is a recursive walk, it will send all tracks from
  the subtree to the playlist. Don't do this at the root of a big tree...
- `Open in new tab.
- `Random play by tracks`: this is analogous to `Send to playlist`, but the
  list is shuffled, and sent to the Renderer by slices, so you can use a very
  big list without swamping it.
- `Random play by groups`: this will play groups of tracks, corresponding to
  the lowest level of directories in the subtree, typically albums, but
  these may also be MinimServer Groups for example.
- `Stop random play`: if currently playing.

While in "Random play by group" mode, the playlist broom tooltip displays
the next group. Clicking the button will skip to it.

Right-clicking empty space will propose to go back (or up).

Mid-Clicking a directory from the entries list, or a search or directory in
the path at the top will open the element in a new tab. This can be
particularly useful if you want to go back to a previous search without
losing the current display.

`^f` or `/` will open the search panel, `Esc` will close it (or the x-cross
button at the right).

link:searching.html[more detail on search].

== Tab bar section

Clicking the big plus sign will open a new tab. Clicking a tab's cross
sign will close it...


== Menus

File:

- `Change Media Renderer` will let you do just this. You will see a dialog
  with the list of renderers currently seen on the network. After choosing
  one, you may decide that the current *upplay* playlist will replace the
  one or the new renderer, or be appended to it by checking the appropriate
  places. Double-clicking a renderer will get you there too.
- `Select Source` is only activated if the current Renderer supports
  OpenHome, and will let you select the Source among the available ones
  (`Playlist`, `Radio` etc.).
- `Save / Load playlist` will let you save the current playlist to a local
  file, or load one which you previously saved.
- `Open Songcast Tool` will open a dialog for managing the connections
  between Linn Songcast Senders or Receivers. link:songcast.html[more
  details here].
- `View`  lets you elect to hide the right panel (directory listing), change
   the color scheme for a dark one and other interesting experiences. Also
   a number of Preferences can be adjusted from the appropriately named
   submenu. 

And `Help`, there is no help...

== Adjusting the font sizes on high resolution displays

Most people will find that the font sizes are too small on high DPI
displays.

As of version 1.2.5, the GUI can be partially adjusted by editing two style
sheet files. To adjust the font sizes:

- Edit `/usr/share/upplay/cdbrowser/cdbrowser.css`, and uncomment the
  "font-size" directive at the top. Adjust the 30px to taste.
- Edit `/usr/share/upplay/common.css` and adjust the 6 font-size
  directives. An adequate approach will usually be to multiply the sizes by
  some constant factor (e.g.: 2 ...).


The adjustment is not perfect for now: the player section does not update
its size, which means that some titles will be truncated (in the top left
area), and the icon sizes are unchanged.

There are other, system-based, approaches described on the following Qt page:
